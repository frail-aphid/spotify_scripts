# Spotify Scripts
I'm a huge music fan and so using the spotify API to automate some of my activities around music organisation and discovery is a no-brainer.

### The Spotify API
The spotify API uses representational state transfer (REST) principles and returns information about spotify objects in json format. Requests are made using HTTPS with a UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. The spotify API supports standard HTTPS actions:

  - **GET** Retrieves resources
  - **POST** Creates resources
  - **PUT** Replaces resources
  - **DELETE** Removes resources

Where a *resource* is any kind of spotify object like a playlist, album, track, artist etc.
